# ✅ Subscription System - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

## What I've Completed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Pricing Navigation

- Routes to `/pricing` page showing all subscription tiers
- Displays current plan with badge

- **Red banner** appears when trial expires
- Shows days remaining and "Upgrade Now" button
- Dismissible but reappears on page reload
- Automatically routes to pricing page

### 4. ✅ Strict Tier Limits Enforced

#### Product Limits
- **Free Trial/Basic:** 50 products max
- **Professional:** 500 products max
- **Enterprise:** Unlimited
- **Enforcement:** Blocks adding products when limit reached
- **UI:** Shows warning at 80% capacity, error at 100%

## How The System Works

### Trial Expiration Flow
```
User Signs Up
    ↓
14-Day Trial Starts (recorded in database)
    ↓
Day 7: Yellow banner appears
    ↓
Day 14: Red "Expired" banner
    ↓
Features remain accessible with reminders
    ↓
User clicks "Upgrade Now"
    ↓
Routes to /pricing page
    ↓
Selects plan → Stripe checkout
    ↓
Payment success → Webhook updates database
    ↓
Banner disappears, full access granted
```

### Feature Gate Checking
```typescript
// The app checks on every page:
1. Get user's subscription from Supabase
2. Determine plan tier (Free Trial/Basic/Professional/Enterprise)
3. Load plan limits and features
4. Show/hide features based on plan
5. Block actions that exceed limits
6. Show upgrade prompts when blocked
```

### Database Schema

**stripe_user_subscriptions table**
- `customer_id` - Supabase auth user ID
- `subscription_id` - Stripe subscription ID
- `subscription_status` - active/trialing/canceled/etc
- `price_id` - Which plan they're on
- `current_period_end` - When subscription renews

**user_subscriptions table** (for trials)
- `user_id` - Supabase auth user ID
- `status` - trial/active/expired
- `trial_ends_at` - When trial expires
- `plan_id` - Reference to subscription plan

## Testing The System

### 1. Test Trial Expiration Banner
```sql
-- In Supabase, run this query to set trial to expire in 3 days:
UPDATE user_subscriptions
SET trial_ends_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '3 days'
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- Refresh app - you'll see yellow banner
```

### 2. Test Product Limits
1. Sign up as new user
2. You're on Free Trial (50 product limit)
3. Try to add 51st product
4. System blocks you with error message
5. Shows "Upgrade to add more" prompt

### 3. Test Import Block
1. Stay on Free Trial
2. Click "Import" button on Inventory page
3. Modal appears showing "Upgrade Required"
4. Cannot import until you upgrade

### 4. Test AI Forecasting Block
**On Basic Plan:**
1. Update database to Basic plan
2. Navigate to `/forecasting`
3. See upgrade prompt instead of forecasts
4. Click "View Plans & Upgrade"

### 5. Test Stripe Payment (Test Mode)
1. Click "Pricing" in sidebar
2. Choose any plan
3. Click "Subscribe"
4. Stripe checkout opens
5. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
6. Any future date, any CVC, any ZIP
7. Complete checkout
8. Redirected to success page
9. Database automatically updated via webhook
10. Features unlocked immediately

## Stripe Configuration

### Current Status
- ✅ Stripe products configured
- ✅ Edge functions deployed
- ✅ Webhooks ready
- ⚠️ Need to add Stripe keys to production

### To Enable Live Payments
Add to `.env` file (or production environment):
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
```

Add to Supabase Edge Function secrets:
```bash
# In Supabase dashboard, add these secrets:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Test Mode (Current)
- Already works with test cards
- No real charges made
- Perfect for development/testing

## User Experience

### When Trial Expires
1. **Banner appears** - Red, prominent, can't miss it
2. **"Trial Expired"** message clear
3. **Features still work** - No hard cutoff
4. **Gentle nudge** - "Upgrade to continue"
5. **Easy upgrade path** - One click to pricing

### When Limit Reached
1. **Warning at 80%** - "Approaching limit" message
2. **Block at 100%** - Clear error: "Plan limit reached"
3. **Upgrade CTA** - Button routes to pricing
4. **No data loss** - Existing data safe

### When Feature Locked

2. **Plan comparison** - Shows current vs required plan
3. **Direct upgrade** - Button to pricing page
4. **No confusion** - Clear messaging

## Admin Features

### Monitor Subscriptions
```sql
-- View all active subscriptions
SELECT
  u.email,
  s.subscription_status,
  s.price_id,
  s.current_period_end
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN stripe_user_subscriptions s ON u.id = s.customer_id;
```

### Check Trial Status
```sql
-- See all trials and when they expire
SELECT
  u.email,
  us.status,
  us.trial_ends_at,
  CASE
    WHEN us.trial_ends_at < NOW() THEN 'EXPIRED'
    WHEN us.trial_ends_at < NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'EXPIRING SOON'
    ELSE 'ACTIVE'
  END as trial_status
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN user_subscriptions us ON u.id = us.user_id
WHERE us.status = 'trial';
```

### Manually Grant Access
```sql
-- Give user Professional plan (for testing/support)
INSERT INTO stripe_user_subscriptions (
  customer_id,
  subscription_status,
  price_id
) VALUES (
  'user-id-here',
  'active',
  'price_1SHzv5LZmi0FJLwynncUasUe' -- Professional
);
```

## Security

✅ **All data protected** - Row Level Security on all tables
✅ **Subscription verified** - Server-side checks via Supabase
✅ **Payment secure** - Stripe handles all payment data
✅ **Webhooks verified** - Signature checking in edge functions
✅ **No client-side trust** - Limits enforced in database

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Add Stripe Live Keys** (when ready to accept payments)
2. **Configure Stripe Webhook URL** in Stripe Dashboard
3. **Test end-to-end** with real payment
4. **Monitor trial conversions** via SQL queries
5. **Set up email notifications** (optional, via Supabase)

## Support Scenarios

### "My trial expired but I still have access"
- **This is intentional** - Soft reminder approach
- User can still use app with persistent banner
- Encourages upgrade without hard cutoff

### "I can't add more products"
- Check product count vs plan limit
- Verify plan in database
- Guide user to /pricing page

### "Import button doesn't work"
- Check if user has Professional/Enterprise
- Verify hasImportCapabilities in code
- May need to upgrade plan

### "I upgraded but features still locked"
- Check stripe_user_subscriptions table
- Verify webhook was received
- Check subscription_status = 'active'
- May need to refresh page
