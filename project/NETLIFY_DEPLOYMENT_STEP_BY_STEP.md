# Netlify Deployment - Complete Step-by-Step Guide

## üöÄ Deploy Your Supply Chain App to Netlify

Follow these exact steps. I'll tell you exactly when to publish.

---

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [ ] Your app is working locally
- [ ] Stripe test mode is working
- [ ] You have a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account
- [ ] You know your Supabase URL and Anon Key (from .env file)

---

## PART 1: PREPARE YOUR CODE (Don't Publish Yet!)

### Step 1: Check Your Build Configuration

Your app is already configured correctly for Netlify. Let's verify:

**‚úÖ Check `package.json` has these scripts:**
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

**‚úÖ Check build works locally:**
```bash
npm run build
```

You should see:
```
‚úì built in 5s
dist/index.html
dist/assets/...
```

If build fails, fix errors before continuing.

---

### Step 2: Create Git Repository (If Not Already Done)

**Check if you have git initialized:**
```bash
git status
```

**If you see "not a git repository":**
```bash
# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - ready for deployment"
```

**If you already have git:**
```bash
# Make sure everything is committed
git status

# If there are changes, commit them:
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
```

---

### Step 3: Push to GitHub (Required for Netlify)

**Option A: Create New GitHub Repository**

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `supplyvision-app` (or your preferred name)
3. **Important**: Keep it **Private** (your code, your business)
4. **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click **"Create repository"**

6. GitHub will show you commands. Copy and run them:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/TaskWise-OS/Bolt-App.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Option B: Use Existing Repository**

```bash
# If you already have a remote
git push origin main

# Or if you need to set upstream
git push -u origin main
```

**‚úÖ Verify:** Go to your GitHub repo in browser - you should see all your files.

---

## PART 2: DEPLOY TO NETLIFY (Still Not Live Yet!)

### Step 4: Sign Up for Netlify

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Choose **"GitHub"** (easiest option)
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
5. You'll land on your Netlify dashboard

---

### Step 5: Create New Site

1. Click **"Add new site"** button (or "Import from Git")
2. Select **"Import an existing project"**
3. Click **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. You may need to authorize Netlify again - click **"Authorize Netlify"**

---

### Step 6: Select Your Repository

1. You'll see a list of your GitHub repositories
2. **Don't see your repo?** Click **"Configure Netlify on GitHub"**
   - Select which repos Netlify can access
   - Choose "All repositories" or select specific ones
   - Click **"Save"**
   - Go back to Netlify tab
3. Find and click your **supplyvision-app** repository

---

### Step 7: Configure Build Settings

Netlify should auto-detect everything, but verify:

**Branch to deploy:**
```
main
```

**Build command:**
```
npm run build
```

**Publish directory:**
```
dist
```

**Build settings should look like this:**
```
Base directory: (leave empty)
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
Functions directory: (leave empty)
```

**‚úÖ If auto-detected correctly:** Leave as is
**‚ùå If wrong:** Manually enter the values above

---

### Step 8: Add Environment Variables (CRITICAL!)

**DO THIS BEFORE DEPLOYING!**

Still on the site setup page:

1. Click **"Show advanced"** or scroll down to **"Environment variables"**
2. Click **"Add environment variables"**

**Add these TWO variables:**

**Variable 1:**
```
Key:   VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: [paste your Supabase URL from .env]
```

Example: `https://xtqtcvjkibkfqrkikoly.supabase.co`

**Variable 2:**
```
Key:   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: [paste your Supabase anon key from .env]
```

Example: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (very long string)

**‚úÖ Double-check:**
- Variable names are EXACT (including VITE_ prefix)
- Values are correct (no extra spaces)
- You added BOTH variables

---

### Step 9: Deploy! (This Makes It Live)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Once you click this, your app will be publicly accessible on the internet!

1. Review all settings one more time
2. Click **"Deploy [your-repo-name]"** button
3. You'll see deployment progress:
   ```
   ‚è≥ Building...
   üì¶ Uploading...
   ‚úÖ Published!
   ```
4. This takes 2-5 minutes

**What's happening:**
- Netlify clones your GitHub repo
- Runs `npm install`
- Runs `npm run build`
- Uploads `dist/` folder to CDN
- Makes your app live globally

---

### Step 10: Your App is LIVE! üéâ

**You'll see:**
```
‚úÖ Site is live
üåê https://random-name-123456.netlify.app
```

**Click the URL** - Your app is now live on the internet!

---

## PART 3: CUSTOMIZE YOUR DEPLOYMENT

### Step 11: Change Site Name (Optional but Recommended)

1. On your site dashboard, click **"Site settings"**
2. Scroll to **"Site information"**
3. Under **"Site name"**, click **"Change site name"**
4. Enter a better name: `supplyvision` or `your-company-supply`
5. Click **"Save"**
6. Your new URL: `https://supplyvision.netlify.app`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Netlify subdomain names must be unique globally.

---

   ```
5. Add to **Redirect URLs** (click "Add URL"):
   ```
   https://your-site-name.netlify.app/**
   https://your-site-name.netlify.app/success
   https://your-site-name.netlify.app/pricing
   ```
6. Click **"Save"**

---

## PART 4: SWITCH TO LIVE STRIPE (Production Mode)

### Step 13: Get Stripe Live API Keys

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** This enables REAL payments!

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Toggle from "Test mode" to "Live mode"** (top right switch)
3. Go to **Developers** ‚Üí **API keys**
4. You'll see:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_live_`) - Click "Reveal"

**Copy the Secret key** (sk_live_...) - You'll need it next.

**‚ö†Ô∏è KEEP THIS SECRET!** Never share it, never commit it to GitHub!

### Step 15: Configure Stripe Webhook for Production

**This tells Stripe where to send payment events.**

1. In Stripe Dashboard (Live mode!), go to **Developers** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
2. Click **"Add endpoint"** button
3. **Endpoint URL** - Enter your Supabase webhook URL:
   ```
   https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
   ```
   
   **How to find your project ID:**
   - Look at your Supabase URL: `https://xtqtcvjkibkfqrkikoly.supabase.co`
   - The ID is: `xtqtcvjkibkfqrkikoly`
   
4. **Description** (optional): `Production Webhook`

5. **Select events to listen to** - Click and check these:
